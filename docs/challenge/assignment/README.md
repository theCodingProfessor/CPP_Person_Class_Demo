//Friend Class Assignment
//Assignment details: In this assignment, you and your partner will explore the concept of friend classes in C++ through pair programming. You will each create a two-file (.h, .cpp) C++ class that utilizes friend classes, and then integrate your classes in a driver file to test their functionality.
//Description: This project is a simple demonstration of an employee management system implemented in C++. It consists of two main classes: FriendClass and PrimaryClass.The PrimaryClass represents individual employees and stores their information such as name, employee ID, and salary. It provides methods to access and modify this information.The FriendClass manages payroll operations such as calculating salaries. It contains a method to calculate the annual salary of an employee based on their salary information.The main() function in the main.cpp file creates an Employee object with initial details, displays the employee information, calculates the annual salary using the PayrollSystem, updates the employee's salary, and recalculates the annual salary to demonstrate the functionality of the system.
