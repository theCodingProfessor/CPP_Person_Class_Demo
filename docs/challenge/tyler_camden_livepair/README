The Friend File Class Assignment
---------------------------------------------
This project demonstrates the implementation of a friend class system.
It involves two main classes: CollegeCourse and MyStudent.
The purpose of this system is to showcase how a friend class can access private data and methods of another class.

CollegeCourse:
- Manages enrollment of students.
- Displays enrolled students.
- Allows access to its private methods by the MyStudent class as a friend.

MyStudent:
- Represents a student with a name and ID.
- Can display enrolled students in a course by accessing private information of the CollegeCourse class as a friend.

Implementation Details:
- The CollegeCourse class establishes a friend class relationship with MyStudent, allowing the latter to access private members of the former.
- MyStudent utilizes this friendship to display enrolled students in a course via a static method displayEnrolledStudents.
