OpenAI Prompt Session as Demo
Prompts (questions list no replies)

### User Prompt
If this repository exists, https://github.com/theCodingProfessor/CPP_Person_Class_Demo how would I initialize a local version of this using an IDE (jetbrains clion) for example. I would like to be able to eventually create a pull request from the local environment, and update the online version with that data. Can you describe a workflow which would allow me to do update remove or edit files for a repository with fewer than twenty or so resources?


### User Prompt
Can you share PowerShell code for Windows 11 machine which allows me to query the system to see if Git is installed and what version it is? Is there a Terminal (for mac) and Linux version as well?


### User Prompt
Can you describe what 'Clean' is as referenced in Creating a New Branch? Where else is code hygiene important?


### User Prompt
Can you explain the purpose of a Commit message? Who is the recipient what should be communicated. Do commit messages replace comments in the source code document?


### User Prompt
How do I keep track of branches? Is it typical for a developer on a team to have multiple branches at a time, or is it best to open change and close (ala atomic) our branches. Are there best practices. Could an .md file be used as a notes file or to-do and list and activity manager? Could you recommend sections for a .md branch management notes page?


### User Prompt
Can you tell me how I can 'see what branches are open', and how to 'close a branch' given JetBrains CLion?


### User Prompt
Can you distinguish between push and pull within git, adding the purpose, use case and limitations for each?


### User Prompt
Can you describe the terms 'fetch', 'update' and 'pull request' in the fashion you have done for push and pull?


### User Prompt
Can you define what base is (as in rebase/rebasing), merge and commit in a similar fashion?


### User Prompt
What is replay as in replayed onto the target branch during the rebase process?


### User Prompt
Is it correct to say that pull receive the work, or a view of work, of any/all branches?


### User Prompt
Is it correct to say that a push shares a view of a branch's work, or the work itself, with others?


### User Prompt
It would appear that a pull request can originate from a repository admin or a developer (local branch) can you describe a use case scenario where this might happen?


### User Prompt
In the admin view (from the previous example), would the admin be able to create a pull request on changes from Developer (from above example) which might be reflected in a push from their branch, but was not otherwise included in their pull request? In short can an origin repository manager create 'pull requests' after seeing just a push from a developer's branch?

### User Prompt
Can you describe in more detail the concept of rebase? If a kind of data can be commits does rebase risk a loss of data? Is the risk of data loss from rebase and merge equal?
