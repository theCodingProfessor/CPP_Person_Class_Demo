""" Can you markup the following assignment for presentation into a .md file """ {assignment text } """

"""
Can you describe the third-component for the github assignments from above, which asks the student pair-programming groups to do the work on the 'coding theme' (friend, inherit, template, poly or composite), both locally and in a shared fashion (commit, fetch, push, etc), which eventually results in their work being reflected in their shared folder being offered as a 'pull request' to the remote origin branch. Can you use the current git-hub assignment template from above, with this as the purpose?
"""

"""
Can you describe a assignment, like the github one above, which asks two students working on one of the pair-programming themes from above, to find each other as each student will then be a known branch in the remote github repo. The purpose of this assignment is to have the students create a new (shared) folder, and for the students to create (in that shared folder) a Readme.md file which contains text about the challenge they have selected. It is in this new directory (where this file will be) that the challenge (two classes, each two files, with a driver file) will eventually reside. When the student pairs have the new directory, and the file, a pull request should be made to share the folder.  Can you use the git-hub assignment template from above, with this as the purpose?

Where the github repository = https://github.com/theCodingProfessor/CPP_Person_Class_Demo

Using this assignment workflow:
``` 
Assignment Component: GitHub Integration
Assignment Description: <>
Assignment Steps: 
1. Clone (if needed) GitHub Repo and create Local Branch
2. Pull updates to your branch including /challenge/ dir 
3. In that directory, create a lastname.md file
4. In that file identify your theme and pair-partner
5. Commit locally, (that file - not your whole project)
6. Push (reveal your work to others)
7. Pull request (that single file commit)
Assignment Deliverables: Create a Pull Request to the repository
Submission Guidelines: Your file should be in /challenge/
Assignment Summary: <>
``` 

Please verify the steps offered in the template assignment are ordered in a correct fashion. Where appropriate please update step(s) phrasing to better describe the action. If needed please add or re-organize steps to follow best practices

Please phrase the <Assignment Description>, <Assignment Summary> and update/improve the <Submission Guidelines> for a college level computer science class learning to integrate object-oriented concepts with a shared git hub repository.

Please phrase the requirements for a pair-programming experience for a college level computer science class studying object-oriented concepts with the C++ programming language.

Use { Learning Topic Theme } to craft the assignment details where each student, in the pair programming group, to create one of the two-file (.h, .cpp) C++ Classes which will work with the other class file (other student) in their group creates. The two students will also have a fifth file, a driver file (i.e., main.cpp and main()) which tests/runs the two student classes.
