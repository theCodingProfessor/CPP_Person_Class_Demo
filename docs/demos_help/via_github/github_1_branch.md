## GitHub (part 1) Clone and Local Branch

Assignment Description: In this GitHub integration assignment, you will collaborate with your pair programming partner to contribute to a shared GitHub repository. The assignment focuses on integrating object-oriented concepts learned in class into a collaborative coding environment using Git and GitHub.

Assignment Steps:
1. Clone Repository and Create Local Branch: Clone the provided GitHub repository to your local machine if you haven't already. Create a new branch for your assignment work.
2. Pull Updates to Your Branch: Ensure that your local branch is up to date with the latest changes from the main repository, including any new files or directories added to the /challenge/ directory.
3. Create Markdown File: Navigate to the /challenge/ directory in your local repository and create a new Markdown (.md) file named using your last name (e.g., smith.md). In this file, identify your assigned theme and your pair programming partner.
4. Edit Markdown File: Edit the Markdown file to include relevant information about your assigned theme and pair programming partner. Provide clear and concise details to inform others about your assignment focus and collaboration.
5. Commit Locally: Commit your changes locally, ensuring that you are only committing the newly created Markdown file and not your entire project directory.
6. Push Changes: Push your local commits to your remote branch on GitHub to share your work with your pair programming partner and others.
7. Create Pull Request: Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository, specifically targeting the /challenge/ directory. Include a descriptive title and any additional context or comments related to your contribution.

Assignment Deliverables: Your deliverable for this assignment is to create a pull request to the main repository, containing the Markdown file you created in the /challenge/ directory. Ensure that your pull request targets the correct branch and includes relevant information in the title and description.

Submission Guidelines: To submit your assignment, follow the steps outlined above to create a pull request. Make sure that your pull request adheres to any specific submission guidelines provided by your instructor, such as naming conventions or additional documentation requirements.

Assignment Summary: This GitHub integration assignment provides an opportunity for students to collaborate on integrating object-oriented concepts into a shared codebase using Git and GitHub. By contributing to a collaborative project, students will gain experience in version control, collaborative coding practices, and effective communication within a team environment.
