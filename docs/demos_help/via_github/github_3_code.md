## GitHub (part 3) Team Challenge

Assignment Component: Coding Theme Implementation and Collaboration

Assignment Description: In this GitHub integration assignment, you and your pair programming partner will collaborate to implement the chosen coding theme (friend, inheritance, template, polymorphism, or composite) locally and share your work through GitHub. The assignment focuses on coding, committing changes, and creating a pull request to merge your contributions with the main repository.

Assignment Steps:
1. Clone Repository and Create Local Branch: Clone the provided GitHub repository to your local machine if you haven't already. Create a new branch for your coding theme implementation work.
2. Implement Coding Theme Locally: Work with your pair programming partner to implement the chosen coding theme (friend, inheritance, template, polymorphism, or composite) in your local development environment. Divide tasks and responsibilities as needed to efficiently complete the implementation.
3. Commit Changes: As you make progress on the coding theme implementation, commit your changes locally to track your work. Use clear and descriptive commit messages to document your contributions.
4. Collaborate and Review: Collaborate closely with your pair programming partner to review each other's code, provide feedback, and address any issues or challenges encountered during implementation. Use tools such as code reviews and pair programming sessions to ensure quality and consistency in your work.
5. Push Changes: Once you are satisfied with the coding theme implementation and have addressed any feedback or issues, push your local commits to your remote branch on GitHub to share your work with your pair programming partner and others.
6. Create Pull Request: Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository, specifically targeting the shared directory related to your coding theme. Include a descriptive title and any relevant context or comments related to your contributions.
7. Review and Merge: Collaborate with your pair programming partner and other contributors to review the pull request, provide feedback, and ensure that the coding theme implementation meets the project requirements and quality standards. Once approved, merge the pull request to incorporate your contributions into the main repository.

Assignment Deliverables: Your deliverable for this assignment is to create a pull request to the main repository, containing the coding theme implementation work completed by you and your pair programming partner.

Submission Guidelines: To submit your assignment, follow the steps outlined above to create a pull request. Make sure that your pull request targets the correct branch and includes relevant information in the title and description.

Assignment Summary: This GitHub integration assignment provides an opportunity for students to collaborate on implementing a coding theme (friend, inheritance, template, polymorphism, or composite) in their local development environments and sharing their work through GitHub. By dividing tasks, committing changes, and creating a pull request, students will contribute to the project's development and demonstrate their understanding of object-oriented concepts in C++.
