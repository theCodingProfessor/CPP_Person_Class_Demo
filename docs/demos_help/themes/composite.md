## Class Composition Overview

Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes the relationship between classes where one class contains an instance of another class as a member. In composition, one class is composed of one or more objects of other classes, and these objects are responsible for the behavior and functionality of the containing class.

Composition is different from the concepts of "friend" classes and "parent<child>" relationships, as it focuses on how classes are structured and organized within a program rather than on the access control or inheritance hierarchy.

Here are key aspects of composition:

1. **Has-A Relationship**: Composition establishes a "has-a" relationship between classes, indicating that one class contains objects of another class as part of its internal structure. For example, a car "has-a" engine, where the engine is an integral part of the car.

2. **Ownership**: In composition, the containing class owns the objects it contains. This means that the lifetime of the contained objects is tied to the lifetime of the containing class. When the containing class is destroyed, its composed objects are also destroyed.

3. **Encapsulation**: Composition promotes encapsulation by allowing objects to be encapsulated within other objects. Each object maintains its own state and behavior, and the containing class interacts with its composed objects through well-defined interfaces.

4. **Flexibility**: Composition offers flexibility in class design, as it allows classes to be composed of multiple smaller components. This enables better code organization, modularity, and reusability by breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts.

5. **Code Reusability**: By composing classes from smaller components, code reuse is promoted. Classes can be reused in different contexts or combined to create new functionalities without duplicating code.

6. **Implementation**: Composition is typically implemented by declaring member variables of other classes within the containing class. These member variables represent the composed objects, and the containing class can access their functionality through method calls or direct access.

Overall, composition is a powerful mechanism in OOP for creating complex systems by combining smaller, reusable components. It promotes modular design, encapsulation, and flexibility, making it an essential concept for software development.
