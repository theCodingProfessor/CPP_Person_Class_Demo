# Assignment Title: Polymorphism Pair Programming Assignment

## Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you and your partner will explore the concept of polymorphism in C++ through pair programming. Each student will create one of the two-file (.h, .cpp) C++ classes that demonstrate polymorphic behavior, and then integrate the classes in a driver file to test their functionality.

## Assignment Steps:
1. **Class Creation:** Each student will create one of the two C++ classes involved in the assignment. Implement a class that showcases polymorphic behavior by defining virtual functions and inheritance relationships. Ensure that the class has appropriate member variables and functions to demonstrate polymorphism effectively.
2. **Polymorphism Implementation:** Implement polymorphism in both classes using virtual functions and inheritance. Define a base class and one or more derived classes that override the virtual functions. Showcase different behaviors of derived classes when interacting with base class pointers.
3. **Class Integration:** Combine the two classes in a driver file (main.cpp) to demonstrate polymorphic behavior. Instantiate objects of both classes, including objects of derived classes, and call the virtual functions to showcase dynamic binding and polymorphic behavior.
4. **Demonstration:** Run the driver file to demonstrate the polymorphic behavior of your classes. Ensure that the output reflects the expected behavior based on the design of your classes and the inheritance relationships defined.
5. **Documentation and Reflection:** Document your code thoroughly, including comments explaining the purpose of each class, virtual function, and inheritance relationship. Reflect on your experience with pair programming and polymorphism, noting any challenges faced and lessons learned.

## Assignment Deliverables:
- Two two-file (.h, .cpp) class files, each demonstrating polymorphic behavior through virtual functions and inheritance.
- One driver file (main.cpp) integrating the classes and demonstrating their polymorphic behavior.
- Documentation comments within each class file explaining the purpose of the classes, virtual functions, and inheritance relationships, as well as how polymorphism is utilized.
- A reflection document discussing your experience with pair programming and polymorphism, including insights gained and challenges overcome.

## Submission Guidelines:
Submit all assignment deliverables as a single zip file through the designated submission platform. Ensure that each file is named appropriately and includes your names and student IDs.

## Assignment Summary:
In this pair programming assignment, you and your partner will explore polymorphism in C++ by creating and integrating two classes that demonstrate polymorphic behavior. Through collaborative coding and testing, you will deepen your understanding of polymorphism and its applications in object-oriented programming.
