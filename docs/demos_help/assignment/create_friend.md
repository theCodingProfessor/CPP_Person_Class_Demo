# Assignment Title: Friend Classes Pair Programming Assignment

## Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you and your partner will explore the concept of friend classes in C++ through pair programming. You will each create a two-file (.h, .cpp) C++ class that utilizes friend classes, and then integrate your classes in a driver file to test their functionality.

## Assignment Steps:
1. **Class Creation:** Each student will create one of the two classes involved in the friend class relationship. One student will create the primary class, and the other will create the friend class. Ensure that both classes have appropriate member variables and functions.

2. **Friend Classes Implementation:** Implement the friend class relationship between the two classes. Define the necessary friend functions or friend classes in each class to allow them to access each other's private members.

3. **Class Integration:** Combine the two classes in a driver file (main.cpp) to demonstrate how they interact. Instantiate objects of both classes and call their member functions to showcase the friend class relationship.

4. **Demonstration:** Run the driver file to demonstrate the functionality of your classes and the friend class relationship between them. Ensure that the output reflects the expected behavior based on the design of your classes.

5. **Documentation and Reflection:** Document your code thoroughly, including comments explaining the purpose of each class, member function, and variable. Reflect on your experience with pair programming, noting any challenges faced and lessons learned.

## Assignment Deliverables:
- Two two-file (.h, .cpp) class files, one for the primary class and one for the friend class.
- One driver file (main.cpp) integrating the two classes and demonstrating their functionality.
- Documentation comments within each class file explaining the purpose of the classes, member functions, and variables.
- A reflection document discussing your experience with pair programming and any insights gained from implementing friend classes.

## Submission Guidelines:
Submit all assignment deliverables as a single zip file through the designated submission platform. Ensure that each file is named appropriately and includes your names and student IDs.

## Assignment Summary:
In this pair programming assignment, you and your partner will explore friend classes in C++ by creating and integrating two classes with a friend class relationship. Through collaborative coding and testing, you will gain a deeper understanding of friend class concepts and strengthen your programming skills.
