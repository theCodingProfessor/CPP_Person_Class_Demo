# Assignment Title: Composite Classes Pair Programming Assignment

## Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you and your partner will delve into the concept of composite classes in C++ through pair programming. You will each create a two-file (.h, .cpp) C++ class that represents a composite object, and then integrate your classes in a driver file to test their functionality.

## Assignment Steps:
1. **Class Creation:** Each student will create one of the two classes involved in the composite relationship. One student will create the primary class, representing the composite object, and the other will create the component class, which will be part of the composite object. Ensure that both classes have appropriate member variables and functions.

2. **Composite Classes Implementation:** Implement the composite relationship between the two classes. Define member variables in the primary class to hold objects of the component class. Implement functions in the primary class to manipulate the component objects and perform composite operations.

3. **Class Integration:** Combine the two classes in a driver file (main.cpp) to demonstrate how they interact as part of the composite object. Instantiate objects of both classes and call their member functions to showcase the composite relationship and perform composite operations.

4. **Demonstration:** Run the driver file to demonstrate the functionality of your classes and the composite relationship between them. Ensure that the output reflects the expected behavior based on the design of your classes.

5. **Documentation and Reflection:** Document your code thoroughly, including comments explaining the purpose of each class, member function, and variable. Reflect on your experience with pair programming, noting any challenges faced and lessons learned.

## Assignment Deliverables:
- Two two-file (.h, .cpp) class files, one for the primary composite class and one for the component class.
- One driver file (main.cpp) integrating the two classes and demonstrating their functionality as part of the composite object.
- Documentation comments within each class file explaining the purpose of the classes, member functions, and variables.
- A reflection document discussing your experience with pair programming and any insights gained from implementing composite classes.

## Submission Guidelines:
Submit all assignment deliverables as a single zip file through the designated submission platform. Ensure that each file is named appropriately and includes your names and student IDs.

## Assignment Summary:
In this pair programming assignment, you and your partner will explore composite classes in C++ by creating and integrating two classes representing a composite object and its components. Through collaborative coding and testing, you will gain a deeper understanding of composite class concepts and enhance your object-oriented programming skills.
