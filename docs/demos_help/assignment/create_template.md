# Assignment Title: Template Classes Pair Programming Assignment

## Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you and your partner will explore the concept of template classes in C++ through pair programming. Each student will create a two-file (.h, .cpp) C++ class that utilizes template programming, and then integrate the classes in a driver file to test their functionality.

## Assignment Steps:
1. **Class Creation:** Each student will create one of the two template classes involved in the assignment. Implement a template class with generic data types to demonstrate the flexibility and reusability of template programming. Ensure that the class has appropriate member variables and functions that can work with any data type.
2. **Template Classes Implementation:** Implement template programming in both classes to enable them to work with different data types. Use template parameters to define the data types used in member variables and functions of the classes. Ensure that the classes are designed to be flexible and adaptable to various data types.
3. **Class Integration:** Combine the two template classes in a driver file (main.cpp) to demonstrate how they interact and operate with different data types. Instantiate objects of both classes with different data types and call their member functions to showcase the versatility of template programming.
4. **Demonstration:** Run the driver file to demonstrate the functionality of your template classes with different data types. Ensure that the output reflects the expected behavior based on the design of your classes and the data types used.
5. **Documentation and Reflection:** Document your code thoroughly, including comments explaining the purpose of each template class, member function, and variable. Reflect on your experience with pair programming and template programming, noting any challenges faced and lessons learned.

## Assignment Deliverables:
- Two two-file (.h, .cpp) template class files, each demonstrating template programming with different data types.
- One driver file (main.cpp) integrating the template classes and demonstrating their functionality with various data types.
- Documentation comments within each template class file explaining the purpose of the classes, member functions, and variables, as well as how template programming is utilized.
- A reflection document discussing your experience with pair programming and template classes, including insights gained and challenges overcome.

## Submission Guidelines:
Submit all assignment deliverables as a single zip file through the designated submission platform. Ensure that each file is named appropriately and includes your names and student IDs.

## Assignment Summary:
In this pair programming assignment, you and your partner will dive into template programming in C++ by creating and integrating two template classes. Through collaborative coding and testing, you will explore the flexibility and versatility of template classes and enhance your understanding of generic programming concepts in C++.
