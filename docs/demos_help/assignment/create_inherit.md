# Assignment Title: Object Inheritance Pair Programming Assignment

## Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you and your partner will explore the concept of object inheritance in C++ through pair programming. You will each create a two-file (.h, .cpp) C++ class that demonstrates inheritance, and then integrate your classes in a driver file to test their functionality.

## Assignment Steps:
1. **Class Creation:** Each student will create one of the two classes involved in the inheritance relationship. One student will create the parent class, and the other will create the child class. The classes should have appropriate member variables and functions to demonstrate inheritance.

2. **Object Inheritance:** Implement inheritance between the two classes. Decide which class will be the parent and which will be the child, and ensure that the child class inherits from the parent class.

3. **Class Integration:** Combine the two classes in a driver file (main.cpp) to demonstrate how they interact. Instantiate objects of both classes and call their member functions to showcase the inheritance relationship.

4. **Demonstration:** Run the driver file to demonstrate the functionality of your classes and the inheritance relationship between them. Ensure that the output reflects the expected behavior based on the design of your classes.

5. **Documentation and Reflection:** Document your code thoroughly, including comments explaining the purpose of each class, member function, and variable. Reflect on your experience with pair programming, noting any challenges faced and lessons learned.

## Assignment Deliverables:
- Two two-file (.h, .cpp) class files, one for the parent class and one for the child class.
- One driver file (main.cpp) integrating the two classes and demonstrating their functionality.
- Documentation comments within each class file explaining the purpose of the classes, member functions, and variables.
- A reflection document discussing your experience with pair programming and any insights gained from implementing object inheritance.

## Submission Guidelines:
Submit all assignment deliverables as a single zip file through the designated submission platform. Ensure that each file is named appropriately and includes your names and student IDs.

## Assignment Summary:
In this pair programming assignment, you and your partner will explore object inheritance in C++ by creating and integrating two classes representing a parent-child relationship. Through collaborative coding and testing, you will gain a deeper understanding of inheritance concepts and strengthen your programming skills.
